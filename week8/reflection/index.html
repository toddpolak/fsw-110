                        <li>Learning how users interact with web applications is one of the most fundamental pieces of your web development toolbox. How is using JavaScript to interact with an application important? Just like your video explanations I would like to see and hear about some specific real world examples.</li>
                        <li>You have seen a lot of hardships caused by not knowing about the DOM or JavaScript answered in this course (think event listeners instead of complex UI animations for navbar interactions). What were some of the things made easier by learning about DOM interactions? What was hard, difficult, or surprising to you and why?</li>
                        <li>What do you feel was your biggest accomplishment in this course?</li>

                        <p>Using JavaScript to interact with an applicaton is important because it improves the user experience. Not having to continuously refresh the page is a big factor in allowing the user to make changes to a somewhat complex form or application. Being able to see their changes reflect immediately, knowing their progress in "real time" during an online application/form is what makes an application more useful to the user. </p>
